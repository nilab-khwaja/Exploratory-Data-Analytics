<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 EDA on Unicorn Companies <a name="about-project"></a>

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** focused on unicorn companies—startups valued at $1 billion or more. The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights using the **DIKW Framework** (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom). The analysis includes valuation trends, funding patterns, industry distributions, geographical breakdowns, and investor impact.
